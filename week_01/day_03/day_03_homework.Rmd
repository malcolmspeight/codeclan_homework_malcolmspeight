# MVP Q1

# read in data 
```{r}
movie_data <- read_csv("data/movies.csv")
```

# row no, col no, col names, col type
```{r}
glimpse(movie_data)
```

# first 6 rows
```{r}
head(movie_data)
```
# Ideas:
# Investigate original_title/title to identify differences
# Find missing/eroneous values in each column
# Is there a pattern to the missing/eroneous values?
# Which movies/columns have the most missing/eroneous values?
# Is there duplicated data?


# MVP Q2

```{r}
movies_selected <- select(movie_data, "title", "runtime", "budget")

movies_selected
```

# MVP Q3

# missing values in title col
```{r}
summarise(movies_selected, count = sum(is.na(title)))
```
# missing values in runtime col
```{r}
summarise(movies_selected, count = sum(is.na(runtime)))
```
# missing values in budget col
```{r}
summarise(movies_selected, count = sum(is.na(budget)))
```
# MVP Q4

# convert missing values in runtime col to zero value (0)
```{r}
movies_runtime <- movies_selected %>% 
  mutate(runtime = na_if(runtime, 0))
```

# count missing values in movies_runtime
```{r}
summarise(movies_runtime, count = sum(is.na(runtime)))
```

# MVP Q5

# Impute missing values in runtime column with median runtime
```{r}
movies_imputed <- movies_runtime %>% 
  mutate(runtime = coalesce(runtime, median(runtime, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

# count missing runtime values in movies_imputed
```{r}
summarise(movies_imputed, count = sum(is.na(runtime)))
```

# MVP Q6

# not yet encountered slice_min or slice_max functions so using head and tail

# 10 shortest movies
```{r}
movies_imputed %>% 
  arrange(desc(runtime)) %>% 
  tail(6)
```

# 10 longest movies
```{r}
movies_imputed %>% 
  arrange(desc(runtime)) %>% 
  head(6)
```

# MVP Q7

# count of movies with budget < $100
```{r}
summarise(movies_imputed, count = sum(budget < 100))
```
# count of movies with budget = $100
```{r}
summarise(movies_imputed, count = sum(budget == 100))
```
# count of movies with budget <= $100
```{r}
summarise(movies_imputed, count = sum(budget <= 100))
```
# overwrite budgets < $100 with median budget
```{r}
movies_imputed <- movies_imputed %>% 
  mutate(budget = if_else(budget < 100, 
                          median(budget, na.rm = TRUE),
                          budget)) 
```

# count of movies with budget = $100
```{r}
summarise(movies_imputed, count = sum(budget == 100))
```


# EXTENSION Q1


```{r}
movies_imputed %>% 
  arrange(desc(budget)) %>% 
  tail(5)
```


# label budgets as small, medium or big
# assume we use movies_imputed variable

```{r}
movie_budgets <- movies_imputed %>% 
  mutate(budget_type = case_when(
    budget >= 4e6 ~ "Big budget",
    budget >= 12e6 ~ "Medium budget",
    budget < 12e6 ~ "Small budget"
  )) 
```


# return top 5 and bottom 5 budgets

```{r}
movie_budgets %>% 
  select(budget, budget_type) %>% 
  arrange(desc(budget)) %>% 
  head(5)
```

```{r}
